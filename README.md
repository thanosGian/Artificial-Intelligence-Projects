# Artificial Intelligence
 This repo contains two seperate projects. 
 The first one, is a Naive Bayes Classifier implementation. We used the *Ling-Spam* dataset, which can be obtain from [here](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software.html).  The second one, is a reversi implementation, where pc moves are determined using the [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm. You can see the rules of the game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi).
